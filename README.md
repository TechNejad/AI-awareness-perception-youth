# AI Awareness & Perception Among Youth in Academia

This is a beginner data science project exploring how students perceive and engage with artificial intelligence in educational settings.

## Overview
We used survey data (Kaggle, 2023) from Cybernetics students to:
- Analyze AI knowledge levels
- Explore emotional responses and perceived usefulness
- Investigate relationships between perception, knowledge, and trust
- Use K-means clustering to group patterns

## Files
- `AI_Perception_Colab.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with full code and visualizations
- `Final_Report.pdf`: Detailed write-up of our process, analysis, and findings
- `Presentation.pdf`: Summary slides used in our project presentation

## Insights
- Students are mostly curious and optimistic about AI
- Higher AI knowledge tends to correlate with more positive views of AIâ€™s usefulness
- Trust is low despite high curiosity

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab

## Notes
This was part of the Introduction to Data Science course for the Artificial Intelligence For Sustainable Societies (AISS) Master's program.
